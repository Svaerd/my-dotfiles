# my-dotfiles

Just a repo where I put some of my dotfiles.

I make this for the sake of storing my configs, but if anyone want to use it, just use it.

usage:

Make sure to chown -R the cloned repo before modifying all the configs or even using it to avoid headache later.

```
 chown -R ~/my-dotfiles
```

Afterwards, create sysmlink in the expected directory:

/etc/keyd/ for keyd (whether you replace the whole keyd dir or or create symlink only for the config file it doesnt really matter. Just whatever method is easier for you)

~/.config for program that you using. eg: nvim, yazi, etc.
